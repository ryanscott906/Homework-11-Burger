# Homework-11-Burger
This app's purpose is to let a person input the name of a burger and have it save to the page. After it's placed in waiting, there's an option to devour the burger, which causes it to move to a different area of the page. Each new entry is stored within a database for later retrieval. Tools we've been requested to utilize in order to permit this functionality include Express, MySQL, and Handlebars. Defining relevant routes to ensure valid communication between files posed a notable challenge, as did conceiving valid syntax needed for other logic-based operations. From crafting an ORM to setup up the HTML structure with Handlebars, there was no shortage of confusion at almost every juncture.
